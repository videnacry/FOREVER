# Develop your project in PHP
## Social web page **FOREVER**!
!['hey'](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/QuestionableSnoopyKentrosaurus-poster.jpg)

This web page makes possible to **create** a **user** with profile, **login**, **update profile**, **post images/gifs or text** lines and **give likes and comments** to these posts! And there is more! Users can send messages in a **global chat**!

But why that *name*?

The name relies on the inhability to erase or update on posts and comments made so enjoy to have a place wher is saved what you would like to erase, and others...
## Prerequisites
To be able to run this page in local you'll need:
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [APACHE SERVER](http://apache.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
## Installing
To install **GIT** just follow the link above in **Prerequisites** to get to the main page where you can freely download a copy of the mentioned software, same for **NPM**!

To get **APACHE SERVER** and **NPM** you can do as with the other two or easily install the whole pack from [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) instead!

So you must use the terminal or your favorite programming software to make a clone of the proyect, this is made with **GIT**, so to make it by the terminal you should go to the page where you want to store the proyect and run git clone like this steps:

1. Create the folder you want to store the project folder, inside (in case XAMPP) xampp/htdocs or (in case WAMP) wamp/www, and go to the path of your created folder with your terminal like:

```cmd
cd c:/xampp/htdocs/phpinfo
```

2. Now we want to download the project, so in the same terminal we put:

```git
git clone "https://code.assemblerschool.com/eloy-rodriguez/develop-your-project-in-php.git"
```

To run this project you need to install bootstrap and jquery with npm! like this (first example for all packages of **NPM** list in the project and next ones for personalized installation of the packages):

```npm
//all packages installation
npm install

//personalized installation
npm install bootstrap jquery

// [i] is same as [install]
npm i bootstrap jquery
npm i jquery
```
## Running the Project
Finally to run the project you must run your server and open the *.php* file you want calling localhost in the browser followed by the path of the file from the folder, for example: 

[http://localhost/develop-your-proyect-in-php/](http://localhost/develop-your-proyect-in-php/)
